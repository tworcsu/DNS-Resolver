Project 3 - DNS Resolver

To run my program:

  python resolver.py commandfile
  (requires python 3)

I completed this project alone.

The program works as intended. I tried to match the sample output pretty
closely. My output from running the provided test file is included.

I really liked this project. Python is cool!
